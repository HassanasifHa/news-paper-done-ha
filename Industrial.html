        <p>As a result of the Industrial Revolution, the agricultural society transformed into an industrial society.
            The Industrial Revolution brought about a dramatic change in the social and economic organization of
            society. As industries grew, the influx of materials –fuels, food, minerals and timber – into the city rose
            sharply. New medicines and better control of infectious diseases through insecticides and improved
            sanitation also grew out of the Industrial Revolution. These important new developments enhanced human
            survival; people began to live longer and population began a rapid ascent resulting in a population
            explosion. This was also the time when population had a marked effect on environment. Let us study certain
            characteristics of human population and see how it affects environment.</p>
