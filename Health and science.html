            Essay on Science and Health:
            Whereas Science has conquered time and space it has also raised great dangers for mankind in the form of
            Atom and Hydrogen Bombs and life. But this does not imply that science in itself is something bad.
            Everything in this universe has a dual application- the good and the bad and it is for mankind to use it in
            the way it desires.</p>
