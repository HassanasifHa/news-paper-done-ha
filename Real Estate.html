        <p>Real estate is property consisting of land and the buildings on it, along with its natural resources such as
            growing crops (eg. timber), minerals or water, and wild animals; immovable property of this nature; an
            interest vested in this (also) an item of real property, (more generally) buildings or housing in
            general.[1][2] In terms of law, real is in relation to land property and is different from personal property
            while estate means the "interest" a person has in that land property.</p>
